# Paseo OMP plugin

Community OMP integration for Paseo. The plugin registers the distinct `omp-plugin` provider and coexists with Paseo's bundled `omp` provider.

> **Alpha preview:** persistence and protocol contracts are tested, but upgrades may still require re-importing sessions created by an earlier preview.

## Quick start

Requirements: Paseo `^0.8.0`, OMP `18.1.15` or newer, and OMP RPC protocol v2.

```bash
paseo plugin add omercnet/paseo-plugins:paseo-omp --ref paseo-omp-v<version>
paseo plugin ls paseo-omp
```

Open the **OMP** sidebar to verify the binary, RPC compatibility, storage, process health, registered providers, and effective native configuration. Then create an agent and select **OMP Plugin**. Normal use requires no plugin-specific settings.

The plugin uses only public Paseo 0.8 provider contracts and registers the distinct `omp-plugin` identity; it does not modify the bundled `omp` provider.

## Paseo provider SDK coverage

This matrix inventories the complete capability set exported by the pinned `@getpaseo/plugin` 0.8.0 provider SDK. It measures strict SDK surface coverage, not general product quality.

**Current capability completeness: 55.9%.** The provider advertises 10 of 17 capabilities (58.8%); nine are complete and `session.configure` is partial.

Scoring is deliberately mechanical so releases remain comparable:

- **100%**: advertised, implemented end to end, and covered by automated provider tests.
- **50%**: advertised with a meaningful subset, but at least one material SDK operation is rejected.
- **0%**: not advertised; requests are rejected rather than silently approximated.
- Overall completeness is the unweighted arithmetic mean of all 17 SDK capability rows.

| SDK capability | Completeness | Support and gap |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `prompt.message` | **100%** | Text, structured attachments, optimistic correlation, streaming, and terminal outcomes map to native OMP prompts. |
| `prompt.command` | **100%** | Native command discovery plus structured `compact`, `autocompact`, `handoff`, `steer`, and `follow-up` dispatch. Individual commands can still fail when their documented OMP prerequisites are absent. |
| `prompt.image` | **100%** | Native image blocks for capable models; private bounded temporary files with cleanup for text-only models. |
| `prompt.output_schema` | **0%** | Not advertised. OMP has no equivalent structured-output contract; `outputSchema` fails visibly. |
| `prompt.steer` | **100%** | Native steering with turn ownership, user-message correlation, stale-target rejection, and terminal race handling. |
| `session.archive` | **0%** | Not advertised. Paseo may archive its agent record, but OMP has no native transcript archive operation. |
| `session.configure` | **50%** | Live model and thinking changes commit and republish native state. Live approval-mode changes require a new session, and non-empty SDK `settings` are rejected. |
| `session.list` | **100%** | Bounded host-wide and cwd-scoped discovery, search, previews, profile-specific session roots, and cleanup-reservation guards. |
| `session.persistence` | **100%** | Versioned opaque handles, exact resume, import, replay-before-ready, runtime recovery, and cleanup quarantine. |
| `session.revert.both` | **0%** | Not advertised because OMP cannot atomically rewind conversation and workspace files. |
| `session.revert.conversation` | **100%** | Native branch-based conversation rewind, replay deduplication, ownership transfer, and failure quarantine. |
| `session.revert.files` | **0%** | Not advertised because OMP does not expose a native file-only rewind contract. |
| `session.subsession` | **100%** | Direct and nested OMP subagents become Paseo child sessions with lifecycle, ancestry, progress, and replay. |
| `session.unarchive` | **0%** | Not advertised; there is no native OMP archive state to reverse. |
| `permission` | **100%** | Typed tool permissions when negotiated, with a bounded generic interaction fallback for OMP 18.1.15. Allow, deny, cancel, timeout, and interruption are covered. |
| `permission.tool_policy` | **0%** | Not advertised. Exact MCP preapproval policy cannot be preserved through OMP `set_host_tools`, so the plugin fails closed instead of broadening access. |
| `timeline.plugin` | **0%** | Not advertised. The provider currently expresses all output with Paseo's built-in timeline item types and registers no provider-owned custom timeline renderer. |

Provider functionality outside the capability flags is tracked separately:

| Provider SDK surface | Completeness | Implementation |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Registration metadata and sanitized SVG icon | **100%** | Stable `omp-plugin` identity, label, description, and bundled icon. |
| Strict `providerOptionsSchema` | **100%** | Command, environment, session directory, RPC timeout, and role-model options are validated and normalized. |
| Availability diagnostics | **100%** | Bounded checks distinguish missing, unrunnable, incompatible, and available OMP runtimes. |
| Catalog cache identity | **100%** | Hash includes effective options, settings, scope, cwd, and default command. |
| Models, modes, and thinking catalog | **100%** | Native catalog is mapped to opaque public model IDs with committed defaults and permission-gated modes. |
| Connection `send` / `onEvent` / `close` lifecycle | **100%** | Request correlation, multi-session ownership, process recovery, teardown, and provider reload/removal are covered. |
| Session launch: cwd, env, system prompt, title, and persistence | **100%** | Complete launch configuration is bounded, validated, forwarded, and re-read on recovery. |
| MCP server forwarding and host tools | **100%** | Configured and caller-scoped Paseo MCP tools are discovered, namespaced, labeled, executed, canceled, and bounded. Exact `toolPolicy` remains the separate 0% capability above. |
| Denied native tools | **100%** | `disallowedTools` becomes an explicit OMP allow-list; unknown names fail closed. |
| Commands and committed session state events | **100%** | Publishes `session.commands`, `session.opened`, `session.config`, `session.ready`, and request completion in protocol order. |
| Built-in timeline snapshots | **100%** | Assistant, reasoning, tools, todos, notifications, errors, compaction, images, and friendly MCP labels use stable IDs and complete snapshots. |
| Usage reporting | **100%** | Periodic, post-compaction, fallback, terminal, timeout, and recovered-runtime samples publish `session.usage`. |

Tracking rules:

1. On every `@getpaseo/plugin` upgrade, diff the SDK's exported `PROVIDER_CAPABILITIES` list and add every new capability here at **0%** before claiming support.
2. Raise a row only when the provider advertises the capability and an observable contract test covers its success and failure boundaries.
3. Keep native-agent limitations at less than 100% even when the adapter itself is complete; do not count undocumented fallbacks as support.
4. Keep the detailed evidence and regression locations in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md); this README is the public progress ledger.

## Compatibility and coexistence

The plugin always remains a separate provider. It registers only `omp-plugin`; it never registers, aliases, overrides, removes, or migrates Paseo's bundled `omp` provider. Both identities may be enabled on the same daemon and selected independently per agent.

Existing agents whose provider is `omp` remain owned by the bundled provider. New plugin agents persist under `omp-plugin` with the plugin's versioned opaque handle. The plugin can list and import OMP-native sessions through its own provider flow, but it performs no implicit conversion of bundled-provider records.

OMP `18.1.15` is the oldest version tested end to end. The direct provider's hard compatibility gate is `rpc-ui` protocol v2: metadata-free legacy ready frames and v1-only runtimes are rejected before a provider session opens because they cannot support the advertised persistence and conversation-rewind capabilities. Typed tool approvals remain capability-gated and fall back as described above.

Install, update, disable, or remove `paseo-omp` independently of the bundled provider. Verify the provider snapshot contains `omp-plugin` after installation; a bundled `omp` entry may remain present and is not modified by this plugin.

## Testing and development

The repeatable Docker canary and every validation command are documented in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md). It covers discovery, modes, text, images, tools, MCP, permissions, steering, interruption, persistence, host-wide and scoped session listing, import, resume, subagents, Hub, usage, plugin RPCs, and conversation rewind.

Use `canary-mock/Deterministic Canary` for assertions. The optional local Ollama model is exploratory and nondeterministic.

## Support

See [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) for ownership, escalation boundaries, supported versions, security reporting, and the repeatable OMP RPC compatibility intake process.
