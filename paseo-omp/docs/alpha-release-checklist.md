# Alpha release checklist

This checklist prepares `paseo-omp-v0.1.0-alpha.1`. It does not authorize publication. A maintainer must explicitly approve the tested package before any push, tag, GitHub release, or npm publication.

## Release identity

- [ ] Release Please proposes `0.1.0-alpha.1` from manifest version `0.0.0`.
- [ ] Package and tag names are `@omercnet/paseo-omp` and `paseo-omp-v0.1.0-alpha.1`.
- [ ] Provider identity remains `omp-plugin`; bundled `omp` remains independent and enabled or disabled by the user.
- [ ] Paseo requirement remains an official released range, currently `^0.8.0`.
- [ ] Minimum tested OMP version, checksum, CI job, README, SUPPORT, and TESTING agree.

## Required gates

- [ ] `npm run check`
- [ ] `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] `npm run test:coverage`; aggregate loaded-source coverage meets the configured threshold.
- [ ] Real installed OMP regression against the documented minimum version.
- [ ] `npm run test:integration:install`
- [ ] `npm run test:integration:docker`
- [ ] Windows/WSL host ownership job passes in CI.
- [ ] Docker canary matrix passes on the exact release candidate.
- [ ] GitHub Actions syntax and release-configuration schemas pass.

## Required manual acceptance

- [ ] Maintainer installs the exact `npm pack` candidate into the controlled official-Paseo Docker canary.
- [ ] Maintainer verifies catalog, prompt, tools, configured MCP, permissions, steer, interrupt, import/resume, subagents, rewind, usage, Hub, and plugin surfaces.
- [ ] Maintainer confirms the known limitations are acceptable for alpha.
- [ ] Maintainer explicitly authorizes publication after testing. Silence or prior approval for development is not release authorization.

## Alpha blocker

- [x] `omp-audit.1`: incomplete or compacted `agent_end` frames recover success, failure, or native cancellation from complete streamed `message_end` evidence, or from bounded history whose entry IDs correlate with the streamed turn. Idle state is confirmed before and after retrieval, and concurrent interrupts remain authoritative. Missing, unavailable, non-correlatable, or conflicting terminal evidence fails closed with content-free count diagnostics.

## Accepted alpha limitations

These may remain only when called out in `SUPPORT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the GitHub prerelease notes:

- Native Fast mode is not exposed.
- No first-class plan mode; `/handoff` depends on native OMP prerequisites not reproduced by the deterministic canary.
- Terminal-started OMP sessions are importable but are not registered automatically.
- Large skill-body presentation has no dedicated provider regression.
- OMP RPC stdout contamination is structurally mitigated but requires upstream channel purity.
- `omp` and `omp-plugin` do not share ownership, configuration, or persisted handles.
- The deterministic model does not implement OMP compaction summarization; protocol fixtures cover compaction behavior.
- The tiny Ollama model is exploratory and is not a deterministic oracle.

## Non-blocking post-alpha cleanup

- [ ] `omp-maintenance.1`: remove `ProviderRegistrationCompat`, both `ProviderCatalogOptionsCompat` declarations, and `parseProviderInputCompat` after the published `@getpaseo/plugin` types natively expose the registration hooks and request fields they bridge. The required upstream surface is `providerOptionsSchema`, `getCatalogCacheKey`, `checkAvailability`, catalog/session-list `providerOptions` plus `settings`, and session-open `deniedTools`. This is type/compatibility cleanup only; it must not change provider behavior and does not block alpha.

## Release notes

The prerelease notes must include:

1. Alpha support statement and compatibility range.
2. Permanent side-by-side `omp-plugin` identity.
3. Provider SDK capability percentage and link to the README matrix.
4. Link to the deduplicated [core-provider issue audit](core-provider-issue-audit.md).
5. Verification totals from the exact release commit.
6. Known limitations above, including the distinction between supported MCP host tools, unsupported exact `toolPolicy`, and native-only `disallowedTools`.
7. Install, upgrade, rollback, support, and security-reporting links.
8. Artifact provenance verification command.

## Publication boundary

Release Please may prepare metadata. Publication must use npm trusted publishing from the immutable release commit. Never retag an alpha commit as stable.
